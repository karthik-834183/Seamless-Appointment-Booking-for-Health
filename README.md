Scenario-based Case Study:

Scenario: Booking an Appointment with a Doctor



User Registration: John, who needs to see a doctor for a routine check-up, visits the Book a Doctor app and signs up as a Customer. He provides his email and creates a password.

Browsing Doctors: Upon logging in, John is presented with a dashboard displaying a list of available doctors and healthcare providers.

He filters the list based on his preferences, such as specialty, location, or availability.

Booking an Appointment: John finds a suitable doctor and clicks on "Book Now." A form appears where he selects the desired appointment date and uploads any necessary documents, such as medical records or insurance information.

After submitting the form, John receives a confirmation message indicating that his appointment request has been received.

Appointment Confirmation: The doctor reviews John's appointment request and availability. Once confirmed, the appointment status changes to "scheduled."

John receives a notification confirming his appointment and providing details such as the date, time, and location.

Appointment Management: As the appointment approaches, John can view and manage his upcoming appointments in the booking history section of his dashboard.

He has the option to cancel or reschedule appointments if needed and can update the status accordingly.

Admin Approval (Background Process): In the background, the admin reviews new doctor registrations and approves legitimate applicants.

Approved doctors are then registered in the app and can start managing their appointments.

Platform Governance: The admin oversees the overall operation of the appointment booking system and ensures compliance with platform policies, terms of service, and privacy regulations.

The admin addresses any issues or disputes to maintain a smooth user experience.

Doctor's Appointment Management: Dr. Smith, an approved doctor on the platform, logs into his account and manages his appointments.

He views his schedule, confirms or reschedules appointments, and updates appointment statuses based on patient interactions.

Appointment Consultation: On the day of the appointment, John visits the doctor's office for his check-up.

Dr. Smith provides medical care and advice during the consultation, fulfilling John's healthcare needs.

Post-Appointment Follow-up: After the appointment, Dr. Smith updates John's medical records and may prescribe medication or recommend further treatment if necessary.

John receives a visit summary and any follow-up instructions through the app.
